This is intended to constitute a standard C library (libc) which conforms
to the Single UNIX Specification, Version 3 (SUSv3).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unless you are a system integrator, do not install this package with a prefix
whose include directory is in your C compiler's header search path.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

To build libc, first install the include package from:

	https://github.com/coreux/include.git

This package includes the ux/cdefs.h header which is required by errno.h.

If building from a git checkout, run:

$ git submodule update --init --recursive
$ autoreconf -i

(This may produce some informational messages which can be ignored)

Next, configure libc:

$ ./configure --prefix=/path/to/ux

If the libc prefix differs from that used to install the include package,
you must specify its location using the --with-ux=... configure option.

Finally, build and install libc:

$ make
$ sudo make install [DESTDIR=/path/to/staging/root]
