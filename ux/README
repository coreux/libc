The contents of this directory are installed to ${includedir}/ux and
constitute implementation-private headers: they should never be included
directly by user applications.

All symbols are prefixed __UX_, and all macros are prefixed "__UX_", in
accordance with XSH 2.2.2 ("The Name Space"):

http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/xsh_chap02_02.html#tag_02_02_02

"With the exception of identifiers beginning with the prefix _POSIX_, all
identifiers that begin with an underscore and either an uppercase letter
or another underscore are always reserved for any use by the implementation."

cdefs.h
    Defines utility macros used by other headers, depending upon the
	compiler in use. When porting to a new compiler, cdefs.h must be
	updated to support it.

machtypes.h
	Determines the host architecture and includes the corresponding
	ux/<arch>/types.h file.

<arch>/types.h
	Defines core types and limits specific to the host architecture. Of all
	the macros defined, only those related to INT64/UINT64 are optional (they
	may be omitted if, and only if, the compiler does not have a native 64-bit
	scalar type). See x86-64/types.h for a canonical example.

<kernel>/types.h
	Defines core types which make up the kernel-userspace ABI. These types are
	exposed to applications through the inclusion of <sys/types.h>. See
	linux/types.h for the canonical example. It is critically important that
	the types specified match those used by the kernel.

sizedef.h
	Defines size_t (included by multiple public headers)

timedef.h
	Defines clock_t, time_t and timer_t (included by multiple public headers)
